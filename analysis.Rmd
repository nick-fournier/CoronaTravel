The cases and trip data are downloaded from the New York Times GitHub page and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, respectively.


```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)

load("./data/merged_covidtrips.RData")


ggplot(data = covidtrips.state) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = date_val, y = number_of_trips)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = date_val, y = cases)) +
  theme_bw()
```


Plot of cases versus number of trips by date and State. There seems to be correllation, but with some time lag. This makes sense given the incubation period of a virus.

```{r}
ggplot(data = covidtrips.nation) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = date_val, y = new_cases, color = "New Cases")) +
  #geom_point(aes(x = date_val, y = trips, color = "Trips")) +
  theme_bw()
```
